      <p class="bio"> This is my favorite hobby because I like sports and this is my favorite. I like the running around to each others goals, the positions in the soccer field, you have to pass to each other, you get exercised, and you have fun! I like the passing thing because you use teamwork, a critical skill in life. I play that at recess, and because of teamwork, though the other team had better players, we almost always win. That is the power of teamwork.</p>

        <div class="line"></div>
      <p class="bio">Hi! I am Aarush Goradia. I am ten years old and my birthday is October 18, 2010. What I like to do in my free time is coding. I code on coding websites like thunkable, code.org, and codepen! I also upload a few projects on a brackets.io platform into github.io. In my profile here, you will see a link to code.org and github. Thunkable I am making a game which is not finished. Then you will get the link to that in my profile. I love coding because you can be free, type whatever you want, make any program you want. That is why I like coding, because you can create anything.
